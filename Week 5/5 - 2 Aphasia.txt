5 - 2 Aphasia
============

Parts of the brain involved in language
- left hemisphere of the brain
- Wernicke's area
- Broca's area
- Arcuate fasciculus (connection between Wernicke's and Broca's area)
- also all over the brain
- no "designated" area

19th century doctors Wernicke and Broca found that the patients with certain speech problems where in these brain areas

Many language related problems are called Aphasia

Wernicke's aphasia:
- fluent aphasia
	patients sound very fluent
	good gramatical sentences
	if you listen closely -> doesn't make any sense what they say
	problem 1: connecting sound/form to the meaning
	The patients know meanings (for example "chair")
		-> but can't articulate the right word
	Problem 2: in understanding
	The patients recognize the word "chair" but cannot connect it to the meaning

Broca's aphasia:
	Non-fluent speech
	Ungrammatical sentences, lots of mistakes
	what they say does make sense
	No problems understanding, but articulating
	Problem: There is something broken in their syntax
		- in their inflectional morphology

Arcuate fasciculus: Conduction aphasia
	- nothing seems to be wrong
	- makes sense and is fluent
	- if you ask them to repeat something
		count from 0 to 10
	- they seem to have a memory problem
