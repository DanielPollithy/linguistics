5 - 3 Everyday mistakes and the foreign accent syndrome
=======================================================

Everydays tiny language errors a mild aphasia?
	- most of the people forget immediately the errors made -> happens all the time
	
Can we create speech errors with tongue twisters?
Do 'future words' influence present words?
- a switch can be seen:
	"my dear queen" -> "my queer dean"

Second language mistakes are the same?
- origin of most mistakes is stress
- interfering primarly language

Is the foreign accent syndrome possible?
	Wake up one morning and suddenly be a fluent speaker in a foreign language?
	-> No!

Actually foreign accent syndrome means something else:
	English speaking woman wakes up and speaks English with a chinese accent. 
	Still really unlikely. 
	Somebody had a stroke -> some of the sounds are affected -> impact on the pronounciation -> accent
