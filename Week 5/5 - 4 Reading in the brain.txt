5 - 4 Reading in the brain
==========================

Where is reading located?
What kind of writing systems do we have?

Reading is strange for linguists:
	less "natural"
		- Most languages don't have a writing system
		- In the languages with writing system there are always analphabetics but never vice versa
		- you learn writing specifically (not picked it up)

Writing systems:
	- Latin script
		- phoneme-based
	- Kana script (Japanese)
		- Syllable-based
	- Han script (Mandarin Chinese)
		- Morpheme-based
	- Hangul script (korean)
		- Phoneme-based (phonological features)

Write in all different direction (top-down, right-left...)

In all writing systems: the letters/symbols for reading are in the same part of the brain
Why?
	- innate? -> no. writing and reading is not "natual"
		only 5000 years -> no enough time to be biologically

Diversity and similarity in writing:
	Reading Recoginition area is also used for 3d-vision
	- the capital T-shape -> innate pattern recoginition

Why 3d-recognition for letters/visions?
Why this? There is also human face recognition areas... why not them?
	-> best possible solution between form and sound
	-> paradox: chinese connects forms to morphemes
		- sounds are important though
