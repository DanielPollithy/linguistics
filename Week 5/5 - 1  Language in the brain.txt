5 - 1  Language in the brain
============================

- Language is found in all human beings
- Then we looked at the software
- Now we look at hardware

How do we produce/understand language?
Which parts are involved?
How does reading work?

Relation between Language and Brain has two schools:
- Brain has made the language
- Brains have adopted to the fact that we are using languages

How do we study this?
Labov said you can study it in the lab -> let's go to the lab
study images like MRA

Two linguistic sub-disciplines
- psycholinguistics
	- studying from the outside
	- the participants behaviour
	- older
	- started in the 19th century with experiments
	- diaries of parents and doctors about language inquisition
	- language development, comprehension, production
- neurolinguistics
	- from the inside
	- same topics are studies but now from the inside
	- brain scans
	- which parts are used?

These two are merging together these days:
participants have to perform tasks while in the brain scanner
