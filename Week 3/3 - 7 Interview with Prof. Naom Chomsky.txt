3 - 7 Interview with Prof. Naom Chomsky
=======================================

Why did Chomsky get into linguistics?
	Boring college courses
	With 16 years to university
	A little disappointed of the sequency of boring courses except of one:
	Arabic, taught by an anti-fascist Italien. It was the year 1945.
	Zellig Harris -> impressed by him
	took chomsky into his post-graduate course
	=> ended up in a weird combination of mathematics, philosophy and linguistics
	His dad's doctoral dissertation was about an old hebrew language (and history of semetics)

Why did he keep on studying languages for all his life?
	recognized and old (full with information) field (Darwin, Decarte, philosophers)
	"Language is source of human creativity" - Naom Chomsky
	Language is an infinite system -> interesting for him. How to obtain infinity from finite data.
	Language is a continous system although our communication system is continous.
		- sentences consist of 5 or 6 words. Not 5,5.
	Digital infinity is an interesting property -> mathematical theory of computation
		-> concept of computability theoretically
		-> until the mid of the 20th century
	Irresistible combination of: accessibility to formal inquiry and carefully and human significance.
