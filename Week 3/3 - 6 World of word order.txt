3 - 6 World of word order
===========================
(Discussion)

How are the word orders spread over the world?
	-> No. S-V-O and S-O-V and V-S-O we have already covered 99% of known languages.

Why are some word orders more frequent than others?
	- the three of them have the subject before the object
		-> seems to be a logical order
		experiment: Different language speaker should use gestures to show the sentence:
		"A girl catches a fish". What all of them did was
			1) A girl
			2) a fish
			3) catch
		S - O - V
		Although their spoken language has a different order -> S-O-V seems to be natural for the participants
		Why is that?
			Linguists are divided in two ideas:
				1. Some parts of grammar is innate (children are born with it) like the subject coming before the object
				2. It is just the logical order of any action (who does what)
			There are exceptions! So why are there any languages which put an object before a subject?
				-> there might be other factor involving the orders

Endless exceptions to the rules...
Is linguistics a science? (like physics)
	- The isolation process which is needed for experiments in physics is not really possible in linguistics
		-> there are always some factors (we cannot put language in a experiment situation)
