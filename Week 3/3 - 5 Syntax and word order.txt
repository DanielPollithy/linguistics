3 - 5 Syntax and word order
===========================
Part two

Lots of parts in a sentence -> many possibilites
	-> a lot of them are actually employed by real languages

But there is a general tendency to word orders:
	-> Typologists study this (most famous Joseph Greenberg 1915 - 2001)
	If a language has V-O it should have prepositions and N-A (French)
	If it has O-V is should have postpositions and A-N (Japanese)
	Of course there are exceptions: English has V-O but A-N and prepositions.

Factor: Question words
	- Question word moves object to beginning of the sentence in English
	- Japanese does not change word order (S-O-V) on a question
