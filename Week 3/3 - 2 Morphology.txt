3 - 2 Morphology
================

Study of words

What does human language consist of?
	-> "words"

But what defines a word?
Three criterias:
	- spaces -> only written language
		- passion fruit, ice cream
			- one word?
		- bad criteria
	- meaning
		- one word = one concept/meaning
		- what is a concept?
	- pronunciation:
		- the word is one form that cannot be interrupted
		- Prosody: the way in which we pronounce words and sentences together

None of them works good. But we are going to use them.

Example: uncovering
un - cover - ing
cover := called the base
un, ing := affix (prefix, suffix) 
	they don't work without the base

These bits are all called morphemes:
	- happiness has two morphemes

Languages differ:
	- isolating languages: 
		- few or no combination of morphemes
		- ej. chinese: one-to-one-relationship:
			-> Morpheme:Meaning
	- agglutinative languages:
		- combination of morphemes in a transparent way
		- turkish: plural
	- fusional:
		- example: arabic
			book -> books -> to write -> writer
			change the vowels 
	- polysynthetic:
		- combine bases and affixes endlessly
		- example: Mohawk (native american New York)
			wahonwatia'tawitsherahetkenhten
			She made the thing, that one puts on one's body, ugly for him
		=> a speaker of Mohawk might have a total different concept of a word

English is between fusional, isolating and agglutinative. Difficult to classify generally.
