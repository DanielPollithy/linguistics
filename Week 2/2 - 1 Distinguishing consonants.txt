2 - 1 Distinguishing consonants
===============================

Subdisciplines of linguistics which study sounds
- Phonetics: studies physical and physiological aspects of sounds
- Phonology: Studies sounds as part of language, omitting linguistically irrelevant details




Phonetics
---------
- Form finite set (20 - 200 vowels and consonantes)
- Building blocks for constructing words

English has more sounds than letters
If you want to write down every sound of every language - International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)

All languages distinguish between consonants and vowels:
	- airstream is not impeded for vowels
	- every syllable has a vowel; consonants are optional
