2 - 4 Sounds in system
===============================

(Phonology)

Distinctions (place of articulation...) are called features in phonology

Assumption:
- Sounds are constituted of features (true atoms are just there features)

Evidence type 1: Phonological activity
- Sound A -> Sound B
- One feature changes into another feature

Evidence type 2: Symmetrie of Consonants

Evidence type 3: Path of acquisition
- path of learning english: voiceless and plosive with labial and coronal
	+ Nasal: m and n
	+ Fricative: f and s

Evidence type 4: Speech errors
- Interchanging sounds: brake fluid -> blake fruid
- interchanging features: cedars of lebanon -> cedars of lemadon (non nasel b -> nasal n and non nasal b)
- Spaghetti -> Skabetti

Features = caraceteristicas (esp.)


2 - 5 Sounds and language change
================================

- nacht -> night
- how does a language change?
	- internally: by every generation
	- by language contact 
		- christmas hawaiian -> taking the consonants

2 - 6
================================

Inquisition of speech
 - structural mistakes and so on...

Chapter Consonant Inventories
- consonant inventory = number of consonants used in a language
- to find different speech sounds look at short words where you only change (i) the beginning (ii) the end (iii) the middle syllable
	 pin, tin, kin, fin, thin, sin, shin
- definition: what is a consonant differs

Vowel Quality Inventory


Vowels build the center of syllables
vowel = vocal (esp)
eau (fr.) water just one vowel /o/

Find different vowels: seat, sit, sate, set, sat, sot, soot, suit

Where the categorization is difficult: 
- vowel length
	t’a /t'a/ means ‘king salmon’, whereas t’aa /t'aː/ means ‘board, plank’
- vowel nasalization
	bon café ‘good coffee’ and bon ami ‘good friend’, /bɔ̃ kafe/ versus /bɔn ami/.
- diphthongs
	lied /laid/ and loud /laud/, involve movement of vowels from a starting position to a different finishing position

In all of them the discussion is whether to call them different vowels or vowels with consonants...
=> the number of vowels would vary a lot

Other method by Phoneticians:
The “timbre” of a vowel sound. 
These are its 
- height (roughly, how open the jaw needs to be to make the vowel), 
- its position in a front-to-back dimension (roughly, whether the tongue needs to be pushed forward, 
	remain more or less in the position in which it rests during normal breathing, 
	or be pulled toward the back of the mouth for that vowel), and 
- the lip position (whether the lips are pushed forward and narrowed or not).


"Spanish is thus counted as having five vowels, which generally are represented quite straightforwardly by the letters i, e, a, o, u in Spanish orthography. The diphthongs which occur in words such as puerta ‘door’ or siempre ‘always’ can be resolved as combinations of two of these basic vowels occurring within a single syllable. For the five recognized vowel qualities in Spanish a simple phonetic categorization can be given in terms of the basic properties as follows: the two vowels represented by /i, u/ are high vowels, /e, o/ are mid vowels and /a/ is a low vowel. The vowels /i, e/ are front, /a/ is central, and /o, u/ are back; /o/ and /u/ are also rounded while the other three Spanish vowels are unrounded."

with 14 vowels German has the most.
