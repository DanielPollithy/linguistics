2 - 4 Sounds in system
===============================

(Phonology)

Distinctions (place of articulation...) are called features in phonology

Assumption:
- Sounds are constituted of features (true atoms are just there features)

Evidence type 1: Phonological activity
- Sound A -> Sound B
- One feature changes into another feature

Evidence type 2: Symmetrie of Consonants

Evidence type 3: Path of acquisition
- path of learning english: voiceless and plosive with labial and coronal
	+ Nasal: m and n
	+ Fricative: f and s

Evidence type 4: Speech errors
- Interchanging sounds: brake fluid -> blake fruid
- interchanging features: cedars of lebanon -> cedars of lemadon (non nasel b -> nasal n and non nasal b)
- Spaghetti -> Skabetti

Features = caraceteristicas (esp.)
