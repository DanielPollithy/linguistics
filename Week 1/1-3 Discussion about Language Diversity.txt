1-3 Discussion about Language Diversity
===========================================

How come we have so many different languages?
Different answers:
- whole idea of idea transfer: 
	- might not be the primary function of language
	- intentionally showing the difference between groups by using different languages
- Every generation has to learn the language again: they might be doing things different (latin -> italian)

Do all languages have the same origin?
Origin of all languages: human sapiens has one origin (east africa)
-> so maybe all languages derive from that (just speculation)
written languages only since 5000 years. Migrations were 100.000 years ago.
Hard to proove.

Do constructed languages qualify as language?
- Star Trek/Lord of the Rings
- ScieneFiction movie with own language
	-> often made by linguists
	-> Answer: A linguistic can't make a language:
		- is the language learned in a natural way? No!
- edge case possible
- where is the community?
