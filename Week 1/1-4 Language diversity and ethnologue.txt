1-4 Language diversity and ethnologue
===========================================

Language variation
How many languages are there in the world?
-> difference between dialect and language
-> we guess: 6000 - 7000 (ethnologue)

Ethnologue is free
- lots of small languages with dying out languages
- estimation: at the end of this century only a few hundreds
	-> document them
- top 10: chinese, spanish, english
- chinese: lots of varieties which might also be called different languages
- languages with 1 to 20 vowel sounds
- examples: 
	- turkish: long words with a lot of meaning
	- vietnamese: sentences with many words
	- chinese: lots of different words
	- english: differentiation between gender (he is nice - she is nice)
		-> chinese speakers do not have to do that

French and Italian (Romance) are called sister languages because they have the same parent language: latin
	- un - uno
	- main - mano
	- homme -uomo
German and english (Germanic):
	- ein -one
	- Hand  hand
	- Mann - man

Romance and Germanic are in Indo-European

other families: Dravidian (south asia) and Niger-Congo (souther sahara)
Confusing relationships between languages

Isolated languages do not seem to be related: Basque

Why can languages be so similar?
- reasons of contact
- physical reason the human body is nearly the same everywhere and so are our brains -> same architecture
