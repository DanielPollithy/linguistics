1-2 Human Language versus other 'languages'
===========================================

Question: Is it true that every human beiing has a language?

We use language:
- communicate ideas
- think
- to show who we are

characteristic society always with language

Language?
- Computer Programming
- Language of Flowers
- Language of music
=> not so called in linguistics

Important:
- native speakers
- speak about everything
- recognized by a group as their language

Sign language?

Question?
- Is speech a characteristics of human language?
- Deaf people -> sign language

Not every gesture is a language. 
But the sign language is a real language.
-> lots of variation
-> not spoken
-> system
-> same functionality (inf. sentence, native speakers, has a group) 

Everybody in the world speaks a language? 
- 'Wolf children': No parents or parents not talking to a child
- Geeny: locked up 20 month - 30 years
	-> didn't learn a language
	-> has not learned the system of language

People who loose their language: 
Aphasia (the partial loss of language abilities as a result of brain damage)
(Stroke)
They loose part of the language (ability to pronounce/understand/gramatical sentence) -> strange sentences
Study '90: Study the relation between language and brain (after death)

=> humans have language in comman (very small minority who doesn't use language)

Additional question: How old is the language?
Language is abstract and gone after talking. How to reconstruct?

Theories:
- Contintinuity based theories: Based on animal communication (more complicated)
- Discontinuity based theories: Something different (something has happened in our evolution that made human language possible) -> Naom Chomsky

In the 19th century there was a society which disallowed linguistics to think about this question.
Until now there is no definite answer.

Strong link between being human and developing language (even deaf people -> sign language)

How come we have so many different languages?
