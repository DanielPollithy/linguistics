Human Language and Animal Communication Systems:
===============================================
- What is language?
- Do animals have languages?
How do we count languages?
What do linguistiks do?

There is communication between animal and humans.

3 Dimensions where human language and animal communication are different:
- Discrete infinity
	discrete = countable
	discrete system with limited number of things in it
	e.g. alphabet. By combining the letters -> inf. words
	Proove: there is no largest sentence "Marcs says, that pete says..."
	Not so for animals: Apes have a limited number of combinations
- Displacement
	Talk about things in the past on the moon or abstract scenes
	Bees can communicate about space (-> where to find honey)
		-> don't talk about honey on the moon
- Joint attention
	- humans work as a team -> human language expresses shared goal
		-> read each others mind in order to help each others
	- apes can look at the same things, but dont work together

Human communication:
- inf. amount of message
- talk about things different than the "here and now"
- cooperative tool
