6 - 6 Interview with Prof. Adele Goldberg
=========================================

Professor of Psychology and Linguist at Princeton

Known for the "constructionist aproach"
	- two meanings
		- construction: learned pairing of form and function
			- the more the merrier
			- relative class construction
		- people construct language (controversial)
			- is there something innate: are we born to except nouns and words?
			- lots of people thought that, because one couldn't believe that 
				- children can do it without effort
				- although adults struggle so hard
			-> domain general pattern
				- we known that children always here the same focused on grammar
				- children and adults always keep track of the probability of word sequences
				- syllables and pictures:
					- we always try to anticipate what the next image or syllable will be
				- the child tries to learn to pack und unpack messages
				- link form and functions of a language
					-> so they have to learn the methods of the language
				- want and need to communicate is the big drive
				- vast memory for language and other things is there
				- "orange is the new black" -> "grey is the new black" -> "50 is the new 40"
					- the second word "black" was a standard
						40 as age with specialthe capabilities of women and so on
					- the substitution as the first word
					-> nobody tells us how this works
				- we know 1000 of semi-idiomatic half-open phrases
			- weird exceptions:
				"the afraid boy" sounds weird to native speakers -> "the scared boy"
					- there is nothing wrong with the semantics or the sound pattern
						- why do children easily avoid this?
						- why have second language learners problems with that?
					-> hypothesis: 
						- children anticipate sentences and expect "the afraid boy"
						- but in fact they hear "the boy that was afraid"
						-> they learn that
						same idea with learning "went" instead of "goed" for "going"
