6 - 4 Politeness
================

There is a structure in language variation that corresponds to social structure.

A structure which exists in every language is politeness.

What is politness: You are aware of the social situation you are in and the person you are talking with.

Face: Technical notion
	- public self-image
	- quality everybody has and we try to protect
	- something like dignity/honor
	- famous theory by Penelope Brown and Stephen Levinson: 
		- distinction between two types of face:
			- negative face
				- want of every person that your actions are unimpeded by other people
				- this is how we usually understand politeness (categorial imperative)
			- positive face
				- to be appreciated by others
		- Example for this:
			- Mrs. Brown is a gardner and very proud of her roses
			- if a visitor gratifies that her roses are beatiful
			- Mrs. B feels that we have saved her positive face
	- Face-threatening act: 
		- speech acts that "change the world"
		- negative face: you don't want others to hinder your actions
		- positive face: you want to be appreciated by others
		-> Mitigation: ways of avoiding face-threatening acts by others
			Example: Instead of: "Turn on the heating!" -> "It's cold in here, isn't it?"
