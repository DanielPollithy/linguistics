6 - 2 Social stratification
===========================

Labov 
	- Philadelphia pronounciation change south pronounced with /au/
	- every generation fronts vowel a little more
	- social class: income, education...
	- same pronounciation difference:
		- young people pronounce it more than old people
		- upper class less than lower class (stays parallel over the time)
		-> children realize that there is a system which they start to respect
	- adding gender:
		- the decay of the frontness of pronounciation made by women is linear
		- man have more of a staircase with a plateu between 20 to 50 years old
		-> explanation of Labov: 
			 - all children learn from their mothers in most cases (1970s -> old research)
			 -> girls at the age of 5 or 6 years 
			 		social difference: for girls the peer group becomes more important: the other girls
			 		-> they start speaking other than their mothers (tendency for overshoot -> accumulation -> change)
			 -> boys keep their pronounciation from the mother
			 		they change their pronounciation when social life becomes important for them (20-50)
			 		-> because of career (everybody starts behaving like the typical man)
			 			-> research is from a time when womean didn't have a career
			 		When they retire -> career not important -> go back to speaking how they did before
