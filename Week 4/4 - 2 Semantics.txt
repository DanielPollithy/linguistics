4 - 2 Semantics
=======================

Semantics

The meaning of words
--------------------

"orange" (the color)
	- not all languages have a word for orange 
	- some languages have only one word for two colors: green and blue area
	- some divide the spectrum in white, black and red
	- analogy: Languages divide the world using different categories

Appearance of colors in order of the existance in languages:
	Dark
	light
	red
	green / yellow
	green / yellow
	blue

-> correlates to the intensity of vision in the human eye

Critics of theories like this:
	- Ethnocentrism (western frame)
	- are there universal aspects?
	- are they given by human biology?

Part of this has to be universal. But also cultural.

Debate language & thought:
	- few color-terms in language -> more difficult to distinguish between colors?
		Experiments results
			-> evrybody sees the difference
			-> knowing color terms: make it quicker. why?
			-> not resolved
