4 - 1 Layers of meaning
=======================
The study of meaning: Pragmatics and Semantics

So far: form of language
Now: Meaning

Philosophic: What is meaning?

In Linguistics: two layers of meaning

Semantic meaning
	is literal
	"I have no money"
		-> testable: true/false
	Works without context

Pragmatic meaning
	What do you want to achieve with the sentence?
	Why does the speaker say this?
	"I have no money"
		-> one reason: information
		-> other reason: order, "give me money"
		-> other reason: excuse, "that's why I look so shabby"
	Always with context:
		often contains "I" and "you"

Outside linguistics textbooks, no sentence exists without pragmatics
-> speaking and writing is always intentionally (pragmatic)
-> there is always an implicit "I" and "you"

Even grunting has a pragmatic but not a semantic sense.
