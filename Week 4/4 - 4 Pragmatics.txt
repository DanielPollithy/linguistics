4 - 4 Pragmatics
====================

Situational meaning - "I do not have any money"

Pragmatics is possible without language (grunting, gestic like pointing)

Semantics is about truth and falsehood.
Some sentences are just none of this.
	- "I name the ship the Queen Elizabeth."
	- "I do" (marrying)
	- "I bet you six pence"
These example are from a british philosopher called J.A. Austin.
-> Austin saying "speech acts" are sentences that do not describe the world
	they change it! (An action)

"Listen!"
"A penny for your thoughts!"
Also not verifyable.

Every sentence changes the world a little bit.


Pragmatic meaning can come from not-saying something.
	Not giving relevant positive reference when talking about a collegue with the boss.
	"My collegue X likes the movie Titanic and takes care about her car."
	-> semantics positive
	-> pragmatics: negative

Ignoring pragmatics:
 	"I ate half of your apple pie" -> is also true if you eat the whole pie
 	Why not say? "I ate the whole apple pie"

 Maxims established by Paul Grice about rules that participants have to obey in conversations:
 - Quantity: provide enough relevant information

 Pragmatics is always there. Never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down! ;)
