4 - 3 Color and snow
====================

(Discussion)

How many color terms does english have?
	Depends on the classification

Do the Inuit really have hundreds of words for snow?
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eskimo_words_for_snow
-> problem with the definition of a word (see agglutanative languages compared to the possibility of sentences)

Could there ever be a definition for "word"?
	What is a book? -> simple definition fails -> e-book still a book? -> there might always be an exception
	Why can't we make real definitions for every-day language? -> it seems impossible -> mystery
	"Barack Obamas book weighs about 500g." -> strange. Because:
		- writing the word was completely abstract 
		- still the book as a real object
		-> using the word "book" in two slightly different senses
		=> impossible to give a definition of non-scientific terms
